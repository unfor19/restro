# Journey

## First thoughts

I need to develop a web application that provides a RESTful API to get recommendations for restaurants.

I'm thinking of developing a few [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions) in Python, and use [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db) to store the restaurants and their properties.

A sample data structure for a restaurant could be:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Pizza hut",
  "style": "Italian",
  "address": "wherever street 99, somewhere",
  "openHour": "09:00",
  "clouseHour": "23:00",
  "vegetarian": true
}
```

I will need to create a few endpoints:

- `GET /restaurants` - returns a list of all restaurants.
- `POST /restaurants` - adds a new restaurant to the list.
- `GET /restaurants/{id}` - returns a specific restaurant.
- `DELETE /restaurants/{id}` - deletes a specific restaurant.
- `GET /restaurants/recommendation` - returns a restaurant recommendation based on the query parameters.

All requests should be logged into a logging system, like they would with AWS CloudWatch, on Azure it's called [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor).

## Starting the project

I found a good starting point - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/azure-function-python-deployment-terraform-huaifeng-qin-jfjtc/

Since Azure is absolutely new to me, I'll first start by creating a dummy function and deploying it to Azure. Once the infra is ready, I'll cover the CI/CD part. After everything is ready, I'll write down the "actual app" that I'm supposed to develop - "restro" :D

Super pivot - I've realized it's an overkill to deploy such a large set of infrastructure, so I'll start by creating [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/getting-started?pivots=stack-python) and deploy a simple Flask app. I feel that Azure App Service is like AWS ECS Fargate.

This looks awesome - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/provision-resource-terraform

- Setting up Terraform to authenticate with Azure - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli

## We have a Makefile

I've created a Makefile to make my life easier. I can now run `make infra-init` to initialize the Terraform infra, `make infra-plan` to see the changes, and `make infra-apply` to apply the changes.

Same goes for the `backend`, which is the API app that I'm going to develop.

## Custom Domain

Since I own https://meirg.co.il, I've added `restro.meirg.co.il` as a custom domain to the Azure App Service. I needed to add a TXT record to my DNS provider, and then add the domain to the Azure App Service. The DNS records was added according to the error that was raised during `make infra-apply`.

## But the Database

So far I've used a dummy variable to store the restaurants. I need to replace it with a real database. I've decided to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) since I'm familiar with it. I've created a new cluster manually via the GUI. The next step is to create a new database and a new user. I'll use the `pymongo` library to connect to the database.

As mentioned in the README.md, I intend to do a [peering connection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-vpc-peering/) between the Azure App Service and the MongoDB Atlas cluster. I've created a new VNet in Azure, and a new peering connection in MongoDB Atlas.

## Pivot the DB

Apparently, MongoDB Atlas supports Peering Connection for non-shared clusters, so I'm dropping this idea, even though it was fun configuring the VNet and the peering connection.

I've decided to use the [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db) since it's a managed service and I don't need to worry about the infrastructure.

Yalla adding it to Terraform, use the CosmoDB MongoDB flavor.

## Hooray "app is in the air" üöÄ

I've deployed the app to Azure App Service, and it's working! I've added a few restaurants to the database, and I can get them via the API. I've also added a few logs to the Azure Monitor.

I can develop the app locally easily by using the commands `make services-up` and `make run` - It runs mongodb and the app locally in development, so the development cycle is quite fast.

To test my app manually (at least for now) I've created a Postman collections for both `https://127.0.0.0:5000` and `https://restro.meirg.co.il`. Here's my exported collection for localhost -

</details>

I'm checking the logs of the app with Azure by navigating to:

1. [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. **App Services** > Select app > **Monitoring** > **Log stream**

Next steps:

1. Monitoring - History of requests should be logged and queried easily - I intend to print successful requests+responses to the Azure Monitor.
2. Azure Budget - I've added a budget alert to the Resource Group, the default is **20$ per month**, but I haven't tested the way it alerts and stops the services, so I should test it.
3. Add a CI/CD pipeline to the project.
   1. Azure
      1. Create an API key and then create a secret in GitHub.
   2. GitHub
      1. Create a CI for building the app
      2. Create a CD for deploying the app - I don't intend to host artifacts, so the deployment will be done directly from the GitHub repo by building the given `tag/branch/version`, this is not smart, but so am I üòÑ
         1. For infra
         2. For backend (app)
4. Draw the infra with [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) - Sounds funny that I don't it in the end, but on the other hand, I had no idea what I'm about to do in the beginning, since I wasn't familiar with Azure at all. I think it's a good idea to draw the infra now, after I've done everything, to see if I've missed something.

Future improvements:

1.  Security test - Inspect possible vulnerabilities of the infrastructure, I performed a very simple test of trying to access https://restro.meirg.co.il without the right header and I get blocked by Cloudflare, which is great. I should perform a more thorough test.
2.  Load testing - A simple [ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) testing to realize the load on the app.
3.  Autoscaling - I haven't configured autoscaling for the Azure App Service, so I should do that.
4.  Thorough understanding of the used services - I've used Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB, but I haven't read the docs thoroughly, so I might have missed some important configurations.
5.  Monitoring - I've added a few logs to the Azure Monitor, but I should add more logs and alerts.
6.  Support multiple environment - I've used a single environment, but I should support multiple environments like `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`. Should be easy enough since I'm using Terraform üôÉ
7.  Unittests - I haven't written any tests, so I should write some tests for the app; That is very unprofessional of me üòÖ. Usually I do it during the development process, but then again, this project was a mystery all the way. I preferred having an app that is up and running, and now I can go crazy and test it. I feel comfortable enough to keep it public, even though it's wasn't battle-tested, since it's protected behind Cloudflare üí™üèª.
8.  Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` - I've added a few notes about how to go through the local development process of this project, but I think it's a good idea to add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Life is hell without Docker

I've decided to add Docker to the project. I've created a `Dockerfile` for the backend; Seems like using a `zip` package was too tough, I wasn't able to use Open Telemetry with it, so I've decided to use Docker. Either way, using Docker is probably better than my hacky way of building and pushing the app, it is also a lot quicker to deploy.

## Cloudflare POST to GET issues

I'm not sure why, but when sending a `POST` request to the API, Cloudflare is returning a 405 error. Looking in the logs, it's as if Cloudflare proxies the request as `GET` instead of `POST`, hence the 405 error. I've tried to disable the WAF, but it didn't help. I've decided to use a `GET` request instead of a `POST` request for the `/restaurants/generate` endpoint.

I need to further investigate this issue, I'm intrigued.

Oh, my, god, I've found the issue - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44776644/azure-asp-web-api-error-405-method-not-allowed - Apparently, I've been using **http**://restro.meirg.co.il instead of **https**://restro.meirg.co.il, and that's why the issue occurred. I've fixed it by using the correct URL in the Postman collection. Embarrassing, but I'm glad I've found the issue üôà

## CI/CD

A bit exciting, the tricky part would be authenticating between GitHub Actions and Azure. I'll follow the instructions - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-a-service-principal-secret - and see how it goes.
